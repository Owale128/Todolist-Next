# Todolist (NextJs) üòÅ

I've developed Todolist-Next, a modern and responsive to-do list built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, connected to a MongoDB database. The application allows users to create accounts and log in, with each user having their own personal to-do lists. Users can easily create, edit and delete records, and all changes are securely stored in the database. I have focused on a smooth user experience and a scalable backend to handle multiple users at the same time.
